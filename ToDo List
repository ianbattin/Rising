TODO:

-Instead of putting everything we want to be accessible by all classes into the GameStateManager class, and then making them static non finals which is super unorganized and messy
	create a new class that GameState extends and put all these methods/variables in here so all of the GameStates can then access them (Hopefully?)
-Create Sprite sheets with basic colored boxes that fill the entire space (20x60? for Characters) (25x25 for tiles) in rainbow colored order
	-Modify the tile class to be able to read a sprite from this sheet and set the tile to that image
-Apply the center string method to the Controls arrays in a way that looks good
-Allow the user to edit the SCALEWIDTH and SCALEHEIGHT, and also set the default to be based on their screen size
-Add rest of the code from Ian's code (Animation, Player, MapObject)
