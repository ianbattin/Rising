TODO:

-Apply the controls to the player! (Currently changing controls does not affect the actual game controls)
-CLEANUP rest of the code from Ian's code (Animation, Player, MapObject)
-Create a separate program that allows us to create a level by selecting our tile and clicking to place (Rather than manually editing numbers)
	-Ian has code copied from a YouTube tutorial to do this, but maybe we want to make our own for the fun of it :D
-Apply the center string method to the Controls arrays in a way that looks good
-Allow the user to edit the SCALEWIDTH and SCALEHEIGHT
