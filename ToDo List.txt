TODO:

-Apply the controls to the player! (Currently changing controls does not affect the actual game controls)
-CLEANUP rest of the code from Ian's code (Animation, Player, MapObject)
-Apply the center string method to the Controls arrays in a way that looks good
-Allow the user to edit the SCALEWIDTH and SCALEHEIGHT
