# Meet Me In Paris (Rising)
Cal Poly Game Development Club - InVox Games


This game was developed as a student project in the Cal Poly Game Development club. 
This game is intended to be free for everyone to enjoy (both playing the game and editing the source code!); <i>the final downloadable executables can be found at <a href="http://invox.itch.io/meet-me-in-paris" target="_blank">invox.itch.io/meet-me-in-paris</a></i>.
<br><br><br>
# System Requirements
The compiled executables support:
- Windows 7 or later (may run on older versions, but your mileage may vary)
- Mac OS X 10.7 or later

<b>Please ensure that you have Java installed and that it is updated!</b>
<br><br><br>
<i>Since this is a Java application, if you find that your operating system is not supported, you are encouraged to download the source code and compile it for yourself. Please ensure you have the latest version of the Java SDK installed to do so.</i>
